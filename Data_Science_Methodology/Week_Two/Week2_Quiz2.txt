From Modeling to Evaluation

1. Select the correct statement.
  A training set is used for statistical analysis.
* A training set is used for predictive modeling. 
  A training set is used for descriptive modeling.
  A training set is used for data visualization.
  
2. Which of the following is correct, in the context of congestive heart failure readmission?
* A false-positive is when a true, non-readmission is misclassified. If action is taken to reduce the patient's risk, the cost of the misclassification is the wasted intervention. This is also called a type I error.
  A false-positive is when a true, non-readmission is misclassified. If action is taken to reduce the patient's risk, the cost of the misclassification is the wasted intervention. This is also called a type II error.
  A false-negative is when a true readmission is misclassified. If no action is taken to reduce the risk, then the cost of the misclassification is the readmission and all the associated costs, plus the trauma to the patient. This is also called a type I error.
  A false-positive is when a true readmission is misclassified. If no action is taken to reduce the risk, then the cost of the misclassification is the readmission and all the associated costs, plus the trauma to the patient. This is also called a type II error.
  
3. Which statement best describes the Modeling Stage of the data science methodology?
  Modeling is always based on predictive models.
* Modeling may require testing multiple algorithms and parameters.
  The Modeling stage is followed by the Analytic Approach stage.
  Modeling always uses training and test sets.
  
4. Model Evaluation includes ensuring that the data are properly handled and interpreted.
* True
  False
  
5. The ROC curve is a useful diagnostic tool for determining the optimal classification model.
* True
  False
