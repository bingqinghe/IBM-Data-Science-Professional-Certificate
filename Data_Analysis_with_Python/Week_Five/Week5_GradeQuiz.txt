Graded Quiz: Model Refinement1. What is the output of the following code?        cross_val_predict (lr2e, x_data, y_data, cv=3)* The predicted values of the test data using cross-validation  The average R^2 on the test data for each of the two folds  This function finds the free parameter alpha2. What dictionary value would we use to perform a grid search for the following values of alpha? 1,10, 100. No other parameter values should be tested  alpha=[1,10,100]* [{'alpha': [1,10,100]}]  [{'alpha': [0.001,0.1,1, 10, 100, 1000,10000,100000,100000],'normalize':[True,False]} ]3. You train a ridge regression model, you get a R^2 of 1 on your training data and you get a R^2 of 0 on your validation data; what should you do?  Nothing, your model performs flawlessly on your validation data   Your model is under fitting; so perform a polynomial transform* Your model is overfitting, so increase the parameter alpha4. Consider the following diagram of 4 fold cross-validation. From the diagram how many folds are used for training?* 3  1  45. The following is an example of what?  Overfitting   Perfect fit* Underfitting
