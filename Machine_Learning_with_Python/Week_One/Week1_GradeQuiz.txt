Intro to Machine Learning

1. Supervised learning deals with unlabeled data, while unsupervised learning deals with labelled data.
  True
* False

2. The "Regression" technique in Machine Learning is a group of algorithms that are used for: 
* Predicting a continuous value; for example predicting the price of a house based on its characteristics.
  Prediction of class/category of a case; for example a cell is benign or malignant, or a customer will churn or not.
  Finding items/events that often co-occur; for example grocery items that are usually bought together by a customer.

3. When comparing Supervised with Unsupervised learning, is this sentence True or False?

        In contrast to Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning has more models and more evaluation methods that can be used in order to ensure the outcome of the model is accurate. 

* False
  True
