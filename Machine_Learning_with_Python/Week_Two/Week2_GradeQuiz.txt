Regression1. Which of the following is the meaning of "Out of Sample Accuracy" in the context of evaluation of models? * "Out of Sample Accuracy" is the percentage of correct predictionsthat the model makes on data that the model has NOT been trained on.  "Out of Sample Accuracy" is the accuracy of an overly trained model (which may captured noise and produced a non-generalized model)2. When should we use Multiple Linear Regression?* When we would like to identify the strength of the effect that the independent variables have on a dependent variable.  When there are multiple dependent variables* When we would like to predict impacts of changes in independent variables on a dependent variable.3. Which sentence is NOT TRUE about Non-linear Regression?  Nonlinear regression is a method to model non linear relationship between the dependent variable and a set of independent variables.  For a model to be considered non-linear, y must be a non-linear function of the parameters.* Non-linear regression must have more than one dependent variable.
