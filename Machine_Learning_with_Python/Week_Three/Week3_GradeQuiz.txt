Which one is TRUE about the kNN algorithm?  kNN is a classification algorithm that takes a bunch of unlabelled points and uses them to learn how to label other points.* kNN algorithm can be used to estimate values for a continuous target.3. What is "information gain" in decision trees?   It is the information that can decrease the level of certainty after splitting in each node.* It is the entropy of a tree before split minus weighted entropy after split by an attribute.  It is the amount of information disorder, or the amount of randomness in each node.
